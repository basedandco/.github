# 🧃 Based & Co. Ltd.
We write code with taste. Mostly questionable taste.
If it’s weird, fun, half-useful or overengineered: we’re into it.

---

## 🛠 What We Do

- 🧰 **Open Source Libraries** – because we enjoy writing code that strangers yell at us about
- 🪄 **Dev Tools** – weird little helpers for weirder big problems
- 🧪 **Prototypes & Experiments** – ideas that may or may not deserve to exist
- 🧼 **Clean Aesthetics, Dirty Commits** – design-forward with commit messages that would make your manager cry

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Who We Are

We’re a loose band of developers, designers, artists, and trolls.
No hierarchy. No suits. Just code and chaos.

<!-- ## 🔭 Currently Working On

- `based-ui` – UI components with questionable boundaries
- `hype.engine` – a micro-framework for maximum regret
- `uncanny-api` – does things to your data that are *probably* legal
- `based-cli` – our flagship command-line tool that sort of works sometimes
